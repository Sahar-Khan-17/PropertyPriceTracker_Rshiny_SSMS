#Project:PropertyPriceTracker_Rshiny_SSMS

Introduction to the Organization
This is an interactive app to help people analyze and visualize the housing market in the Dallas and to provide them with data on various types of homes for sale. Home prices in Dallas usually vary. Because home prices depend on the year it was built, the bedrooms of the house and the floor level. Our app can gather enormous information to provide buyers with data on which areas sell the most homes and what kinds of properties are sought after. 


Scope of Project
The scope of the project is to develop an R shiny based web tool for visualizing with the help of lucid charts by utilizing the data gathered from multiple sources. We want to use this app to provide our users with an overall image of the real estate market in Dallas. With this app, users can access the for-sale/ new listings inventory according to target factors including but not limited to price, property size, city, bedroom/bathroom numbers in Dallas. Besides the current data the project applied, end users can also insert new listings, modify current listings according to market status and remove the records after the property is sold.
Our database includes several factors associated with home sales including, but not limited to: street address, zip code, sale price, sale date, property size, bedroom/bathroom numbers in a property, days on market.

Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to create an interactive page using historical housing data. It will provide easy way for clients to narrow down the search results based on square, price and number of bedrooms and bathrooms etc. And provide data visualization method for clients to analyze the properties in Dallas. Users can also know price distribution based on zip code to derive purchase strategies. The project will also allow clients to find property available and the price of it based on a map.  Functions including inserting new listings, modifying current records and deleting no need records are also included for updating the current database.

Our Intended users would be the following: 
i. Customers: One stop shop to define and compare your house requirements from different location, price and size
ii. Sellers/Brokers: To stay updated with the current market standards/prices 

The organization creates value for customers during their planning stage to purchase a house since it is a huge one-time investment and considers a lot of factors like the price, size, etc. They can also use this app to manage their property listing information.
We propose to build an R shiny application which can help potential customers to have an estimation and clarity before actual purchase based on their filtered requirements.
